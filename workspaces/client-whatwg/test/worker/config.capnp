# This is an example configuration for running unit tests.
#
# (If you're not already familiar with the basic config format, check out the hello world example
# first.)
#
# Most projects will probably use some sort of script or tooling to auto-generate this
# configuration (such as Wrangler), and instead focus on the contents of the JavaScript file.
#
# To run the tests, do:
#
#     workerd test config.capnp
